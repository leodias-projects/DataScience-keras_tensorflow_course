# Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Python

This repository objective is to present the codes and knowledge obtained during Sundog Education course Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Python. Most of the codes presented here are based entirely on the lessons, with minor modifications and added comments for documentation.

The course can be find [here](https://sundog-education.com/course/deeplearning/) and is divided in 7 sessions. The repository files are **Jupyter notebooks**, because I want to write stuff between codes!

## 1. Introduction 

This section provides information about neural networks concepts, such gradient descent, autodiff, and softmax. Additionaly, the foundantions and inspiration for neural networks are presented, the biological analogy, a single artificial neuron, LTU, perceptron and multi-layer perceptrons. 

**Lessons**
  - Course introduction
  - Getting started and pre requisites
  - History of Artificial Neural Networks
   
## 2. Tensorflow and low-level API

In this section, a tensorflow playground was introduced, where is possible to test different datasets with different models and neural network sizes. A few more details about neural networks are presented, such as backpropagation, activation functions, optimization functions, and how to tune the topology and avoid overfitting. Then, tensorflow itself is introduced, how it works and what it does. Finally, the handwritting problem with MNIST data is solved!

**Lessons**
  - Hands-On in the tensorflow playground
  - Deep Learning details
  - Introducing tensorflow
  - Using tensorflow for handwriting recognition, part 1
  - Using tensorflow for handwriting recognition, part 2
  - Check out our bigger courses

## 3. Tensorflow and the V2/Keras API

Here, the tensorflow API for Python - Keras - is presented. Keras allow to develop neural network models very easily. The handwriting problem is revisited, and a new challege to identify political affiliations based on votes is proposed.

**Lessons**
  - Introducing Keras
  - Using Keras to learn political affiliations
 
## 4. Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutionals Neural Networks are presented is this section, and the handwriting problem is again revisited. This time, with a proper image classification technique, the accuracy of the model goes up with ease.

**Lessons**  
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Using CNNs for handwriting recognition

## 5. Recurrent Neural Networks

This section presents the Recurrent Neural Networks, its properties (feedback - output as input for neurons), and a challenge to classify movies based on text reviews as bad or good is solved. 

**Lessons**
  - Recurrent Neural Networks
  - Using RNNs for sentiment analysis

## 6. Neural Networks in the Real World

How to obtain already trained models for specific problems, tuning neural networks, and other subjects are approached in this section.

**Lessons**
  - Transfer learning
  - Tuning neural networks
  - Deep learning regularization techniques
  - The ethics of deep learning
  
## Final Project
Lastly, the final project. The challenge is to detect if a mammogram mass is benign or malign based on its features!
**Lessons**
  - Deep learning project intro
  - Deep learning project solution
  - Learning more
  - Subscripe to Keep Learning with Frank!
