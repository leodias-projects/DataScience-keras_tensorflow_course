# Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Python

This repository objective is to present the codes and knowledge obtained during Sundog Education course Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Python. Most of the codes presented here are based entirely on the lessons, with minor modifications and added comments for documentation.

# Knowledge obtained (updating)

This course provided the following contributions:
- It provides information about neural networks concepts, such gradient descent, autodiff, and softmax;
- The foundantions and inspiration for neural networks are presented, the biological analogy, a single artificial neuron, LTU, perceptron and multi-layer perceprons.
- 

The course can be find [here](https://sundog-education.com/course/deeplearning/) and is divided in 7 sessions. The repository is being update accordingly to the lessons/sessions completed, and each session is a repository folder. The repository files are **Jupyter notebooks**, because I want to write stuff between codes!
